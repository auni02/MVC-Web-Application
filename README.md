## Introduction

This proposal outlines the development of a user-centric online platform for managing badminton sports facilities. The system, which will be constructed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, will include various features to improve user experience. Court scheduling, membership enrolment, contact us, friendly sessions, and a payment mechanism are important elements. This platform seeks to simplify court reservations, offer practical membership choices, ease contact with facility administration, and guarantee safe and easy user payment processing.


## Objectives

This project aims to develop an administrative web application to efficiently manage badminton sports facilities.

Court Management: Give administrators an easy-to-use interface to effectively manage court availability, schedules, and bookings. * **Simplify Membership Administration:** Provide a streamlined process for managing member information, memberships (enrolment, renewals, status), and related data.

Friendly Session Management: Provide tools for administrators to create, schedule, manage participants, and track details of friendly sessions. This will promote community engagement and simplify the organization of recreational play.

Ensure Secure and Transparent Payment Tracking: Develop a robust payment tracking system that provides administrators with a clear overview of all financial transactions related to court bookings and memberships. This will enhance financial transparency and simplify reconciliation processes.

## Features and Functionalities

**Friendly session**

create : allow admin to create a friendly session by entering the details such as, session ID, Court number, category, date, time, and players name.

read : allow admin to read the friendly list database.

update : allow admin to update if there is any changes needed to update.

delete : allow admin to delete the friendly session from list.

**Member registration**

create: allow admin to insert new member in the databases along with member's informations.

read: allow admin to view list of members, members' informations and their membership status.

update: allow admin to edit members' informations.

delete: allow admin to delete members from list.

**Payment Method**

   View Payment Records (Read): The system displays a list of payment transactions, including:
    No: A sequential number for each transaction.
    User ID: A unique identifier for the user who made the payment.
    Payment ID: A unique identifier for the specific payment transaction (e.g., a transaction number).
    Amount: The amount paid (e.g., RM12, RM18).
    Date: The date the payment was made.
    Payment Method: The method used for payment (e.g., FPX, Credit Card, Touch 'n Go).
    Status: The current status of the payment (e.g., COMPLETE, PENDING).

Track Payment Status (Read): The admin can view the status of each payment, allowing them to monitor successful and pending transactions.

Generate Reports/Print (Output): The system provides a "PRINT" function, suggesting the ability to generate reports or print payment records for record-keeping and reconciliation.

Handle Pending Payments: a robust payment management system also includes the ability for the admin to:
    Manually update the status of pending payments: If a payment is confirmed through other means, the admin should be able to manually change the status to "COMPLETE."
    Investigate failed or incomplete payments: The system provides tools to help the admin identify and resolve payment issues.
